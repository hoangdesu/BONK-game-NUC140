* Whac-A-Mole style game with a mix of my favorite meme - BONK!
* Implemented for Nuvoton Nu-LB-NUC140 development board

### How to play
* Try to hit Cheem the dog by pressing the corresponding keys on the keypad
* You get 5 lives, don't get **BONKED!**

#Acknowledgement
Tool for converting between images and byte arrays: https://javl.github.io/image2cpp/. Configure as below to display properly on LCD:
- Background color: Black
- Invert image colors: Yes
- Adjust brightness / alpha threshold to expectation
- Scaling: scale or stretch to fill canvas
- Center everything
- Code output format: plain bytes
- Draw mode: Vertical - 1 bit per pixel (since this LCD uses vertical scan)
- Generate code and benefit!

Also I'd like to send my thanks to my teammates Thu·∫≠n, Trung, Tri·ªÅu for helping with this project. Fun story, this project was done during the heat of Corona pandemic in Ho Chi Minh city, where I didn't get to touch the board until the very last days. I paired up with 2 other guys who had the board, where I wrote the program and send it over to them to check pixel by pixel. Jeez it was a pain üòÇ. After nights of pair-programming in irritation, they finally managed to get the board deliver to me to fully work on the game. Finaly the product got shipped just an hour before the deadline =))
